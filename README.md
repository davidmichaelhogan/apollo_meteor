 Issues:
 Analytics page - rework: select campaign
 Create loading dialog for graph

Little things todo:
 - credit card info constraints
 - Duplicate ad button (how to pay for duplicate?)
 - Try new font for Headline / title
 - Download CSV button & edit timeframe
 - Setup Flow Router for Navigation
 - Prevent user from setting past date begin/end or current date for end
 - Add reset click & impression data to "edit ad"
 - Add button to last page of Stepper to return to ad table (flow router?)
 - Add category settings to ad stepper & ad editor
 - MAILCHIMP API to like email (on signup)
 - Add "Enter" function to add stepper & editor in subline
 - for some reason the csv button on analytics page is the wrong color
