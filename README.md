###Apollo Ad Server
http://launchapollo.com

Things to do:
 - fix ads table to pull click & impression data from Events collection & remove click & impression counters from ads collection
 - fix analytics page data processing
 - Create meteor methods for: delete ad, upload new ad, payment, etc
 - login screen
 - refactor server publishings to use "is user signed in"
 - finish front end of analytics pages
 - for some reason the csv button on analytics page is the wrong color
