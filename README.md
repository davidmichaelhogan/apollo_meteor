Big things to finish up:
 - SETUP SIGN UP PAGE
 - Account settings page - clear Stripe saved card Information
 - Email & Name save on register (add name field to user account Collection - Mailchimp API connect)
 - Left Footer links (legal, homepage etc.)
 - Add snack bar to notify actions
 - Duplicate ad button

 Issues:
 card payment tabs
 Analytics page - rework: select campaign
 ** Try to edit ad display time (less of a wait, see if clicks increase)
 RETURN THE GECKO

Little things todo:
 - credit card info constraints
 - Try new font for Headline / title
 - Download CSV button & edit timeframe
 - Setup Flow Router for Navigation
 - Prevent user from setting past date begin/end or current date for end
 - Add reset click & impression data to "edit ad"
 - Add button to last page of Stepper to return to ad table (flow router?)
 - Add category settings to ad stepper & ad editor
 - MAILCHIMP API to like email (on signup)
 - Add "Enter" function to add stepper & editor in subline
 - for some reason the csv button on analytics page is the wrong color
 - fix ads table to pull click & impression data from Events collection & remove click & impression counters from ads collection
